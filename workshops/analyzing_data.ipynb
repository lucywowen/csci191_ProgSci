After selecting one, you can also add a question mark (e.g. `numpy.cumprod?`), and IPython will return an explanation of the method! This is the same as doing help(`numpy.cumprod`). Similarly, if you are using the “plain vanilla” Python interpreter, you can type `numpy.` and press the `Tab` key twice for a listing of what is available.
